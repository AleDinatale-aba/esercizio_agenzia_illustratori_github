                <p>Camilo Huinca's work is rich with colour, content and a 
                    brightly illustrated narrative that speaks for itself. 
                    Born and raised in Santiago in Chile, Camilo has divided 
                    his career between graphic design and painting. Working 
                     independently has allowed Camilo to “develop (his) own style, 
                     having a main focus on the use of curiosity,” he explains.
                     In 2014 Camilo set up Perfe Studio where he concentrates on 
                     graphic design projects in “a more commercial way”.

                <p>CHowever, within illustration, he described his main motivation as, “to be able to generate
                    a communication method based on simplicity and synthesis, with few tools and colours. I 
                    am interested in identifying people’s behaviour, portraying activities, intimate moments,
                     body gestures, disfiguring objects and reducing the amount of detail in a composition.”
